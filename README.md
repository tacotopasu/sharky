# Sharky
Sharky Client ðŸŒŠðŸ¦ˆ is an AMAZING(ly broken) ChatTriggers module with various functions, made with cuteness and goofyness in mind â™¡

Some functions that I remembered to write here are:
- Toggle Sprint
- A fancy calculator
- A (broken atm) armor hud!
- Probably like 1 more module i think

Furthermore! We might add more features to this when we feel like it! And finally, look at this cool shark hehehe it's a blahaj yk blahajs right? The funny cute blahajs from IKEA? YOU KNOW THEM? THOSE FROM IKEA? THE CUTE SHARK PLUSHIES?

6/29/2024 / Making this repository public once more, I don't plan to update this anytime soon, but there's no loss in having this code open out there (aside from shaming myself publicly by showing the terrible soup i've cooked in these .js files...), hope it helps somebody <3 - tacotopasu
